## Magic the Gathering card browser

This web app welcomes a user that can browse, sort and filter 100 random Magic the Gathering cards provided from and API.

Created with React Hooks, React Router, Context API and React multi select component

This is the advanced version of this web app. Unlike the original, version 1, this version uses custom multi select components.
They are much more compatible with styling and different web browsers. I consider this version to be the final and representative version of the project.
